# M-TRACE

## What is it?
M-TRACE (a.k.a., the MATLAB toolkit for raytracing simulations in a canvas environment) is a simulation tool for students, scientists, and engineers for performing non-sequential 2D raytracing.

Simulations in M-TRACE are created using SVG (scalable vector graphics) files that can be created using illustration tools like Inkscape (link) and Adobe Illustrator.
